 <p id="Nine">Hi my name is krishna I am study in Heritage school sector 62 in 7th grade in section D. I am 12 yeras old . and I am a member of the student council . 
 I have just gotten into the student council and i have many achivements 
  I am an artist who loves drawing . I will give everyday website updates (please check :D)</p>

<section id="StudentCouncil"><h1>StudentCouncil</h1></section>
<p  class="text-right"id="zero">I have just joined the student council. It has been a good achievement for me. The student council
has given me many oppurtunities to imporve middle program . I have started my own magazine the eco narrations 
 and I am working on many events and recently I am working on a bullying case . This has given me an
experience of how a election takes place , voting and how democracy works . In our school there is a 
sp(Senior Program) student council which i also want to get into too. I managed to get into student council in my first
try not many other can don't worry even the most great people fail many times before achieveing .
<p id="one"> a question still remains how did i get in first try ? I followed these tips
-being popular in school (very sociable and having many friends).
-Having good grades ( my grades and workethics were assesed and taken into consideration).
-Having a good speech ( clear begining , middle , end and stating your point ).
-always be in second place ( really helps because most people pay attention).
-(younger audience use [props]).
- Find out what they want and add it in your speech.
-This will 90% work for sure.
<h3 id="audi">TheAudience</h2>
<p id="two">Audience can be of any types Question how to deal and get .
good votes. here are some tips
-What audience is understand that ask the person organising the election 
-Reserach on their problems add it into your problems. </p>

<h4 id="speech">The Speech</h4>
<p id="three">In this part many people get very nervous but don't worry I have more tips.
-No reading this is the biggest mistake anyone can make.
-Memorise your speech and don't read it make it like a conversation.
-Use props .
-Trasnitions.
-Have a good pace while reading (This helps a lot because then only the audience understands what your speaking.)
-Dress in a good manner (My reccomednation:a coat and good jeans ).
-Your room ( this matters a lot )(A good background a clean room and a neat table).
-Have a badge this very imrpotant it makes an impact.

<p id="five">This dosen't have to be the same design you can design your own props I use canva to make it. The first one 
is a placard and the second is a badge . </p>

<p id="four">Final step:Practice ,Practice and practice . Do it in front of yoru family or in the mirror . This 
gives a lot of confidence to do in public.
